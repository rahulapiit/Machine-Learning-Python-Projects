This project was created to understand the global trends in investments so that Spark Funds (Asset Management company) can take the investment decisions effectively.

The data is taken from real investment data from **crunchbase.com**

The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
