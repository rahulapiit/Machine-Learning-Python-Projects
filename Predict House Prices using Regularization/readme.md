In this assignment, an advance regression model is built using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Regularisation techniques such as Ridge, Lambda and ElasticNet are applied to create an optimal model.

The project aspires to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
