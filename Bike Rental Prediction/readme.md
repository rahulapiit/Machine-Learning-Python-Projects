This assignment is a programming assignment to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

A bike renting company recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.

The project aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
