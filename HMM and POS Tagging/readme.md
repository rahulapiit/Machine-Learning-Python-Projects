# Syntactic Analysis (HMM Based POS Tagger)
![enter image description here](https://github.com/rahulapiit/Machine-Learning-Python-Projects/blob/main/HMM%20and%20POS%20Tagging/POS_tag.png?raw=true)

Build your own HMM-based POS tagger and implement the Viterbi algorithm using the Penn Treebank training corpus.

Modified the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using **at least two techniques**.

1. Using Rule based (Regex) approach
2. Using Transition probability  as state probability when  emission probability is zero

For this assignment,  the Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset has been used. The [Universal tagset of NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tag/mapping.html) comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.
